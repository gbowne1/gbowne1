# 👋 Hi, I'm Gregory Bowne (aka gbowne1)

I'm a 48-year-old from the Pacific Northwest 🇺🇸 with a passion for tech, CNC, vintage computing, electronics, homebrew computing, OSDev and radio hobbies. Most people just call me **GB**. You can hear how to pronounce my last name [here](https://www.howtopronounce.com/bowne).
