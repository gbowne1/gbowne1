### Hi there 👋 my name is Gregory Bowne aka gbowne1.  I am a 44 year old small business owner in the manufacturing sector.  I own a machine and fabrication / engineering workshop with ~250 employees as of 4/30/2021.  I also do manufacturing consulting as well as ERP & MRP software consutling for the major ERP and MRP software packages for regional manufacturing compaines and small machine shops.

Some people have a hard time pronouncing my last name properly, so I prefer most people call me Greg or GB.  But if you go to this website and listen to the audio you can hear the correct pronunciation.  https://www.howtopronounce.com/bowne

I am easy to find online if you search gbowne1 in google and that has been my user name since the 90s..  I have LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram. Twitch.

I have written 19 technical articles on Metrology and Metallurgy and several on manufacturing and metalworking processes.

I do not work as a developer out in the wild.  I am not looking for a job in a developer role.  I code as a hobby, mostly working on my own projects.

I have tons of hobbies and most of them are crafts.  I also enjoy tech hobbies and programming.  I used to do a lot of coding pre-2003 but had to stop in order to focus on the growth of business. I used to love building PC's and will get into doing that again.  I have done most of my own IT work for my home and business with the help of a couple friends I have met over the years.

I also am into radio and electrionics hobbies, as well as designing computers in the 8, 16 and early 32bit realm.  

I am currently working on several long term electronics projects including mostly computers in the Motorola 68k and also a few others.

My current system is based on a newer generation of Intel Core i7 at almost 4GHz and is fine for my needs.  I have 32GB of RAM and a 2gb Nvidia Quadra 4000 and a total local disk space of 8TB. I have several home servers including mostly Dell R series including R710, R720 and R730's and a pair of MD1200's.  I have a 2nd system for doing CAD and CAM programming for CNC machinery.

I no longer actively run Windows, post Windows 7 EOL in [January 2020].  I have lots of experience with 95, 98, XP, ME, 2000, Vista and 7. Active Directory, IIS and PowerShell.  I am also experienced with Microsoft Office through Office 2010 Professional, especially Access.

I am running MX Linux on bare metal as well as on a VM using ESXi. I actively use 9 other VM's including CentOS, EndeavourOS, Fedora, Debian, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu and Arch, although I am no huge fan of Arch. I also have a FreeBSD VM.  My favorite distro base is Debian.  

My base editor is Visual Studio Code.  My alternate is Sublime.  Yes, I have others installed and have used others.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - RadioLogger, A SWL and Radio Hobby related contact logging app in PostgreSQL, Express, REACT, NodeJS.
  - SPMS ERP/MRP, A ERP/MRP app in the same stack as above, a replacement for Odoo, JobBoss, E2 Shop, etc.
  - The Art of Tech:NPWAFT website for our group.
  - SPMS's website to replace the one on Webs.com 
  - Personal Blog, Portfoilio site in WordPress
  - TwitchBot for Twitch Streamers in Javascript using TMI.js

As for a "License" I chose GNU GPL 3.0 as it seems to fit my style.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, ES5/ES6 Javascript, REACT, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL.  I am also trying to learn components like Babel, Webpack, etc.

- 👯 I’m looking to invite people to help with and collaborate with me on TwitchBot and RadioLogger and SPMS ERP/MRP especially and gain community contributions to the projects.

- 🤔 If you need help with a project I do sometimes contribute to open source projects.. but generally only have time to give advice.  I am truly sorry I couldn't help more.

- 💬 Ask me about The Art of Tech: Not Playing with a Full Tech which is a social media tech group.  We started on Facebook in March 2020.  We encourage you to join and become part of our awesome community we are trying to build of people that work in IT and programming and various other tech fields as well as hobbyists that enjoy tech.
 
    {Please see this link for our links: https://linktr.ee/taotnpwaft}
 
Looking for people to help develop and/or serve our website and email, which likely will reside at https://www.taotnpwaft.org

- I often ask for help code reviews while I learn new things, especially on coding streams on Twitch or in various Discord servers I participate in..  Keep in mind that my primary experience came from pre-2003 coding tools and technologies especially within Windows.  I wrote my first website which was hosted on AOL and also on Earthlink for a short time in the late 90s.

- My code base has historically been:
- - C++ 98
  - Microsoft BASIC on 8 and 16 bit systems.
  - Zilog Z-80, MOS 6502, Motorola 680x0 and Intel 8086/8088 processor develompent in C, BASIC and Assembly
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, PHP and Ajax.
  - Writing device drivers in C for 'Legacy' devices. Once Plug-n-Play came into play,where the 'Generic Windows Device Drivers library'; Windows could not properly enumerate/identify the device correctly or much less than that actually work, so it usually set it up with a generic driver for a specific device vs a OEM driver.
  
 - 💬 You may also see me occasionally produce videos for my YouTube channel gbowne1 and or live stream from Twitch.  

-  😄 Pronouns: ... He, Him however I prefer you actually refer to me by name.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
