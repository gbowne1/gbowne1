### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Gregory Bowne aka gbowne1.  I am a small business owner in the manufacturing sector.  I own a machine and fabrication / engineering workshop with ~250 employees as of 4/30/2021.  I also do manufacturing consulting as well as ERP & MRP software consutling for the major ERP and MRP software packages for regional manufacturing compaines and small machine shops.

I do not work as a developer out in the wild.  I am not looking for a job in a developer role.  I code as a hobby, mostly working on my own projects.

I have tons of hobbies and most of them are crafts.  I also enjoy tech hobbies and programming.  I used to do a lot of coding pre-2003 but had to stop in order to focus on the growth of business. I used to love building PC's and will get into doing that again.  I have done most of my own IT work for my home and business with the help of a couple friends I have met over the years.

My current system is based on a newer generation of Intel Core i5 at almost 4GHz and is fine for my needs.  I have 32GB of RAM and a 2gb Nvidia Quadra 4000 and a total local disk space of 8TB. I have several home servers including mostly Dell R series including R710, R720 and R730's and a pair of MD1200's.  I have a 2nd system for doing CAD and CAM programming for CNC machinery.

I no longer actively run Windows, post Windows 7 EOL in [January 2020].

I am running MX Linux on bare metal as well as on a VM using ESXi. I actively use 9 other VM's including CentOS, EndeavourOS, Fedora, Debian, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu and Arch, although I am no huge fan of Arch. I also have a FreeBSD VM.  My favorite distro base is Debian.

My  base editor is Visual Studio Code.  My alternate is Sublime.

  - The Art of Tech:NPWAFT website for our group.
  - SPMS's website to replace the one on Webs.com 
  - Personal Blog, Portfoilio site in WordPress
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, ES5/ES6 Javascript, REACT, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL.  I am also trying to learn components like Babel, Webpack, etc.

- I often ask for help code reviews while I learn new things, especially on coding streams on Twitch or in various Discord servers I participate in..  Keep in mind that my primary experience came from pre-2003 coding tools and technologies especially within Windows.  I wrote my first website which was hosted on AOL and also on Earthlink for a short time in the late 90s.

- My code base has historically been:
  - Microsoft BASIC on 8 and 16 bit systems.
  - Zilog Z-80, MOS 6502, Motorola 680x0 and Intel 8086/8088 processor develompent in C, BASIC and Assembly
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, PHP and Ajax.
  - Writing drivers in C for 'Legacy' devices once Plug-n-Play came into play where the Generic Windows Device Drivers library did not identify the device correctly or much less than that actually work.
