# About Me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Gregory Bowne aka gbowne1.  I am a 45 year old small business owner in the manufacturing sector in the great Pacific Northwest USA. 

Some people have a hard time pronouncing my last name properly, so I prefer most people call me Greg or GB.  But if you go to this website and listen to the audio you can hear the correct pronunciation. Please see: [How to Pronounce my name](https://www.howtopronounce.com/bowne).

I am easy to find online if you search gbowne1 in google and that has been my user name since the 90s..  I have LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram. Twitch.

Pronouns: ... He, Him however I prefer you actually refer to me by name.

## My current work

I own a machine and fabrication / engineering workshop with ~250 employees as of 4/30/2021.  I also do manufacturing consulting as well as ERP & MRP software consulting for the major ERP and MRP software packages for regional manufacturing companies and small machine shops. This includes E2, JobBoss, Odoo, Microsoft Dynamics,  

As for programming, I do not work as a developer out in the wild.  I am not looking for a job in a developer role.  I code as a hobby, mostly working on my own projects.

I am experienced in Mechanical CAD, CAM and CNC Programming. I do not do architectural drawing, although I learned mechanical/technical drawing in 6th/7th/8th grade and became a teachers assistant in the drawing room.

The core of my experience is primarily AutoCAD 2002-2009, but switched to Fusion 360 in mid 2013.  I became an Autodesk Certified Instructor in July 2005.  I no longer use any Autodesk products personally.  I have since switched to FreeCAD and KiCAD.

I occasionally do CNC programming for 3 and 4 axes milling and lathes for a fee, but you must have a model available.  

I am also a Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) for Microsoft Office products through Office 2010 on Windows.

## My past work

I was a BBS System Operator with a 4 Line Wildcat! BBS System plenty of file door's, download libraries from 1991-1996.

I have written 19 technical articles on Metrology and Metallurgy and several on manufacturing and metalworking processes.

In 1997, I built a functional ERP and MRP (with some CRM too) system for a 50 employee small job shop / machine and fabrication shop with Access and Excel with database using SQL complete with dashboard and some Office 95/97/98 functionality to replace a RBASE:5000 system that ran in DOS 6.22 that was originally meant only to store  

Between 1997 to 2007 I built computers for people that needed custom built computers, mainly people who couldn't afford new computers or the latest and greatest PC's.  I stopped doing this due to market saturation.

## My Hobbies

I have tons of hobbies and most of them are crafts.  I also enjoy tech hobbies and programming.  I used to do a lot of coding pre-2003 but had to stop in order to focus on the growth of business. I used to love building PC's and will get into doing that again.  I have done most of my own IT work for my home and business with the help of a couple friends I have met over the years.

I collect vintage machine tools and do metalworking / machining as my main hobby.

I also am into radio hobbies and electronics hobbies as well as designing computers in the 8, 16 and early 32bit realm.  I listen to a lot of Shortwave radio in the frequencies between 1,700kHz/1.7MHz and 30MHz.

I love building antennas for 500kHz through 1.3Ghz, especially 500kHz through 1.8 MHz.  Mainly copper pipe loop antennas and some ultra-thin wire MW loop antennas using Litz wire.  I actively participate in local radio DX parties.

The furthest away radio station on AM (Medium Wave) I have heard is one radio station in Roswell, NM on a RadioShack DX-390 late at night using the internal antenna.

I am active on GMRS and FRS in my area.  Plans for 2022 include getting my CB (10/11m) dipole antenna back up in the air.  I also intend on doing some DTV/HDTV DXing and getting better TV antennas up.  My real aim for the 2022-23 is to do more active MW DX.

## Electronics Projects  

My current electronics projects are on Hackaday.io but I have not had time to update them.  These eventually may get their own repository.

* a 68030 50MHz system on a 9x12 PCB
* a dual CPU computer that has a Z80 and a 8086/8088 CPU.  (almost like the Digital [DEC] Rainbow 100)
* a rackmount VHF/UHF scanner radio with with four (4) TI DSP TMS320's that covers ~30MHz to 1.3GHz  
* a multi-board/planar CNC control for VMC's/Mills and Lathes
* a computer based on a Motorola MC68000P8 CPU chip and 16MB RAM
* a EATX size Socket 462 mainboard/motherboard
* a dual Pentium II EATX size mainboard/motherboard
* GMRS 50w Base Station transceiver  
  
## Future Projects

I have a 2nd system for doing CAD and CAM programming for CNC machinery.  I also have a system running MX Linux for doing audio and video production and streaming.  

## My Server(s) and lab

I have several home servers including mostly Dell R series including R710, R720 and R730's and a pair of MD1200's housed neatly in a off-lease Dell server rack I got on marketplace.

I use CISCO, Netgear and Linksys networking gear but primarily CISCO Gigabit

My other server is a HP Proliant DL360 G7 with 32GB of RAM that I am in the process of upgrading from a base model.  It runs my personal websites with Apache 2, MySQL, PHP and for now CentOS.

I generally run ESXi for VM's.  I may eventually look at Proxmox.

## My Preferred Operating System

I am running MX Linux on bare metal as well as on a VM using ESXi. I actively use 9 other VM's including CentOS, EndeavourOS, Fedora, Debian, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu and Arch, although I am no huge fan of Arch. I also have a FreeBSD VM.  My favorite Linux distribution ('distro') base is Debian.

I no longer actively run Windows, post Windows 7 EOL in [January 2020].  I have lots of experience with 95, 98, XP, ME, 2000, Vista and 7. Active Directory, IIS and PowerShell.  I am also experienced with Microsoft Office through Office 2010 Professional, especially Access.

### My IDE/Editor

My base editor is Visual Studio Code.  My alternate is Sublime.  Yes, I have others installed and have used others especially Visual Studio 2019 and Atom.  Yes I can use emacs, vi, vim.

## My Browser

I should probably use Chrome but.. I use Firefox.  But that being said, I also test with Chrome Developer Tools.  

### My Current Coding Projects

## Contact

ðŸ“« How to reach me: I have Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitch, YouTube. All have the same name and github ID as this repo.  Reach out to me if you would like to help with any of my projects or with TAOT:NPWAFT.  Most of the repos have the Discussions tab turned on.  I always use gbowne1 for a user name on every platform I am on.

Note: I often ask for help code reviews while I learn new things, especially on coding streams on Twitch or in various Discord servers I participate in. Please Keep in mind that my primary experience came from pre-2003 coding tools and technologies especially within Windows, so I am trying to catch up with new coding styles and updates to the languages I code in that have come out since then.  

## My Codebase & Style

* C++ 98
* Microsoft BASIC on 8 and 16 bit systems.
* Zilog Z-80, MOS 6502, Motorola 680x0 and Intel 8086/8088 processor develompent in C, BASIC and Assembly
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, SQL, PHP and Ajax.

I mostly learned pre ES5 Javascript and am trying to catch up with all the new Javascript goodies.
I started learning HTML and CSS in 1997 trying to make my first web site

I started writing device drivers in C for 'Legacy' devices. Once Plug-n-Play came into play, the 'Generic Windows Device Drivers library' and I found out that  Windows could not properly enumerate/identify the device correctly or much less than that actually work, so it usually set it up with a generic driver for a specific device vs a OEM driver.
  
You may also see me occasionally produce videos for my YouTube channel gbowne1 and or live stream from Twitch.  

âš¡ Fun fact: ...

I don't really have any good fun facts but you are always welcome to ask me anything related to the above.  I know stuff, just not all the things.  I do like to learn all the things so that things do not become hinderances to me.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... learning more about C#, Bash, Vi and Vim.

ðŸŽ§ I have a Pandora staton called Stressed Out Radio here: https://www.pandora.com/station/3960158081900970617

I am Always open to chat about my projects, general coding questions or anything in between. Drop a line and say "hello"!
